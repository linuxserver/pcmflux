# Third-party licenses

pcmflux itself is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](LICENSE).
This file inventories what a built `pcmflux` extension contains or loads and
the license of each piece; `pcmflux/deny.toml` and the `Licenses` workflow keep
the crate graph to the licenses listed here.

Categories: copyleft (GPL-style: the combined binary must follow the license),
weak copyleft (LGPL: the library stays under its license and must remain
replaceable, dynamic linking is fine), permissive (attribution only). MPL-2.0
is file-level copyleft and is grouped with the permissive licenses. pcmflux has
a single build configuration and contains no copyleft (GPL) component.

## Native libraries

"How used" is what was observed on the built extension (`readelf -d`, `ldd`)
and in the crates' build scripts.

| Component | License | Category | Build | How used | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| libpulse (PulseAudio client library, via `libpulse-sys`) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | weak copyleft | default | linked shared library (`NEEDED libpulse.so.0`), found with pkg-config; the manylinux wheels bundle it with the libraries it pulls in (below) | capture and playback through PulseAudio or PipeWire-Pulse |
| libopus (via `opusic-sys`) | BSD-3-Clause | permissive | default | built from the source the crate vendors, with cmake, and linked statically, so no `libopus.so` is loaded or bundled | Opus encoder, single-stream and multistream; `opusic-sys` itself is BSD-3-Clause |
| CPython (`libpython`) | PSF-2.0 | permissive | default | extension module: symbols come from the hosting interpreter, nothing is linked | `pyo3` with `extension-module` |
| glibc (`libc`, `libm`, `libdl`, `libpthread`) | LGPL-2.1-or-later | weak copyleft | default | linked shared libraries, as for every program; musllinux wheels use musl (MIT) | C runtime |
| libgcc_s | GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1 | permissive in effect | default | linked shared library | GCC runtime |

## Rust crates

Resolved with `cargo metadata` (normal dependencies only): 20 crates, every one
permissive (MPL-2.0 for `pcmflux` itself); no crate is GPL, LGPL, AGPL, or
unlicensed. Build-only dependencies (`cmake`, `pkg-config`, `cc`,
`pyo3-build-config`, and their dependencies) are MIT/Apache-2.0 as well and are
covered by cargo-deny.

## What the wheels bundle

- manylinux wheels (cibuildwheel, `pyproject.toml`): `pulseaudio-libs-devel`
  comes from the manylinux_2_28 (AlmaLinux 8) image and auditwheel bundles
  libpulse together with everything it links into
  `pcmflux.libs/` (the published 2.0.0 wheel: libpulse, libpulsecommon,
  libasyncns, libsndfile, libsystemd, libgcrypt, libgpg-error, libmount,
  libblkid under LGPL-2.1-or-later; libdbus-1 under AFL-2.1 OR
  GPL-2.0-or-later and libcap under BSD-3-Clause OR GPL-2.0-only, both usable
  under their permissive option; libFLAC, libvorbis, libvorbisenc,
  libogg, libuuid, libpcre2-8 under BSD-3-Clause; liblz4 BSD-2-Clause; libgsm
  under its ISC-style license; liblzma and libselinux public domain;
  libxcb, libX11-xcb, libXau, libXi, libXtst under MIT). Nothing in the wheel
  is GPL-only; the LGPL libraries stay separate `.so` files and can be
  replaced, which is what the LGPL asks for.
- musllinux wheels: Alpine's `pulseaudio-dev`; the same libraries under the
  same licenses. libopus is not among them in either wheel: it is compiled from
  the source `opusic-sys` vendors and linked into the extension itself.
- The wheels carry pcmflux's own LICENSE only; this file is the inventory of
  the rest, whose license texts live in the upstream packages named above.

## How this is enforced

`pcmflux/deny.toml` is the [cargo-deny](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/)
policy: the allow list is permissive-only (MIT, Apache-2.0, Apache-2.0 WITH
LLVM-exception, ISC, Zlib, Unicode-3.0, MPL-2.0), so a GPL, LGPL, or unlicensed
crate fails `cargo deny --exclude-dev check licenses bans sources` (run from
`pcmflux/`), which `.github/workflows/licenses.yml` runs on every push and pull
request. The native libraries above are outside what crate metadata describes:
a new binding crate means a new row here. `pcmflux/Cargo.toml` has no
`license = "MPL-2.0"` field; `deny.toml` clarifies it.
